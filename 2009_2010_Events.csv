","The representavives of Ukrainian party together with Labour movement ""Solidarity"" today, on April, 8th, picketed the General Consulate of Poland in Lviv. Over 100 people picketed against the supposed anti-Ukrainian provocations of Poland. Ostap Stakhiv, the organisator of the action, reported that the picketing was aimed against anti-Ukrainian provocations from Poland. The problem concerns both the European Parliament resolution considering deprivation of Stepan Bandera of status of Hero of Ukraine and the exhibition on the issue of the "" Volhynian massacre"", that was opened today in the Ukrainian Dim in Kyiv. Ostap Stakhiv reported that 5 representatives of the Ukrainian party were detained today while protesting against organisation of the exhibition that was aimed at the discreditation of the Ukrainian national movement. Yuri Hrynchak, the journalist, also claimed that Ukraine affords to develop Polish minority. Nevertheless, the anti-Ukrainian hystery spreads all over Poland. After approximately an hour of chanting, the protesters quit their action after warning that this was not the last protest action. ",Lviv,Lviv,OUN-UPA,,,101,5,0,0,N,,0,0,,,,,,
